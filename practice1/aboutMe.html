                    <b>How did you start?</b>
                    <p>
                        Ark started off as a random project of mine that I would just test this and that while programming. It originally started off as just an open world filled with some bare trees and grass, a nice colorful skybox, and some simple animation of the vegetation.  As I continued my search to learn new techniques and means of creation I continued adding in simple things; spear, pickaxe,  axe,  pistol,  rifle, and all that follows. It eventually reached the point where the only thing I desired to achieve was Artificial Intellegence (AI). It was then at this point where I decided (due to a previous statement I made before creating this project) "Im gonna make a game that has freaking dinosaurs man...." word for word that was the only reason I had dinosaurs in the game. As funny and meaningless as it seemed at the moment of me making this statement it later came to cause major success. 
                    </p>
                    <br/>
                    <b>How did people find your game?</b>
                    <p>
                        Once I had completed basic AI and refined tooks and other world items i decided to throw the project onto Steam's GreenLight process which at the time was only called early access.  I never took this project to be serious and I only saw means of putting Ark onto the store  just for the purpose of letting other people play and test it out on June 2nd 2015. At this time the game was only worth $15.  The timing I had released the game was probably the most important and ONLY reason it became popular. At this time survival games were trending and dinosaurs started trending shortly after the games release.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ark had made over $1 million dollars in profit within the first month of being released! Now being that this was in the Summer of my soon to be Freshman year at Rockhurst High School I decided it was only fitting to hire employees who would carry out thoroughly developing my game. 
                    </p>
                    <br/>
                    <b>What are the profits of Ark?</b>
                    <p>
                        As mentioned before Ark made over $1 million dollars within the initial release of the game.  Midway inbetween the first month of the game being released I raised the price up to $30 until August 29  when I released Ark to retail (selling physical copies of the game at places like Bestbuy, Target, Walmart, etc) the price raised to $60 because I cant sell my game at a higher price to retailers and keep it lower online. Presently today there have been over 8.8 million sales over all platforms PC, Xbox 1, and Playstation. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       Now if you're wondering when and where all this money goes: Around 50% of my income goes into investments and savings, 10% goes to various charity organizations, 30% is saved for company expenses, and 10. Also to put it to scale to say I sold Ark for $45 (average price between the years) and 8.8 million people bought the game thats 396 million 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For a more detailed representation of my profit distributionresentation of my profit distribution:        (Do note this is not entirely accurate)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Say I sold Ark for $45 (average price between the years) and 8.8 million people bought the game thats $396 million .  198 million goes to investments, 39.6 million goes to charities, 118.8 million goes to company expenses, and another 39.6 million to my own personal fun spending.
                        
                        (you can do simple maths to figure out the total revenue)
                        
                        You're founder and CEO of Studio Wildcard. Do you have employees?
                        
                        Yes, 9 of them actually. Being that my partner who is being held liable for myself (my contract signer) lives in Kirkland, Washington the company technically started there. There are 3 others who live in Washington and the rest are slightly spread throughtout the country.
                    </p>
                    <br/>
                    <b>Where did you meet these people?</b>
                    <p>
                        I have worked on many projects throughout my time and many of my employees are actually people I worked with on these projects.
                    </p>
                    <br/>
                    <b>Why havent I heard of your name before?</b>
                    <p>
                        Keep in mind I released this game around 2 and a half years ago, that also excludes the amount of time I put into development before releasing the game. In total its been about 3 or 4 years meaning I was 14 turning 15 when I started developing this game. As nerdy as it sounds I have always been taught to protect your identity on the internet because you never know who you could be dealing with so back then I had made a policy that if fame ever came along that I would wait untill I turned to a legal adult at age 18.  Now even me announcing this information is against one of the few legal agreements I had ensettled as a requirement to abide to before one could work for me and that was that no one can disclose any personal information that would reveal who I really am. 
                        
                        To further explain why nobodies heard of my name aside from that major point is that I had "hired" a public image. Jesse Rapczak, one of the other listed founders. Now dont get confused, just because he (to the public) is listed as and makes official announcements to the public, he is only following my orders of what to say and what to know.
                        
                        As mentioned before I do plan on making the official announcement of my ownership and creation this coming summer of 2018. However, there are still times where I feel I should reconsider because once people find out there is no going back.

                    <b>Have you bought anything fun?</b>
                    <p>
                        Heck yeah! However id completely recommend talking to me in person about this topic.
                    </p>
